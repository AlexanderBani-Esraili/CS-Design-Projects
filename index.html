    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my paragraph element colored red!</p>

      <div class="box"><p>In this project I practiced and worked on my ability to move things around using the arrow keys, along with engaging my curser and its ability to click and affect my code and what is shown. My project is called, "A Barn Full of Mysteries," because as you get further into the code, eventually a pig begins to show up in the barn full of sheep. This was a very fun project, and what made it enjoyable was the fact that we were tasked to create a code that could be interactive with who's viewing it.</p>

      <div class="box">  <p>In this project I worked on my ability to create a code that can be flexible and adapting depending on what word you insert before running it. For example, as you enter the word, "winter," and run the code, you begin to see a landscape with aspects from that season. You see rain along with necessities needed for the winter such as umbrellas. Additionally, if you were to insert the word, "summer," or "spring," you will begin to see a code filled with a landscape consisting of aspects from those seasons. For summer, you see people playing outside, along with the birds and sun out. As for spring, you see an apple tree alongside a little bit of cloudiness. </p>

      <div class="box">  <p>This is a project that I enjoyed beyond what words can explain. In this project, I tracked the amount of hours I slept for about 2 weeks or so, and in doing this I then created a graph with the data and what affected certain patterns. In this project, I payed attention to aspects that may affect my sleep, such as the amount I worked out that day, along with how much I was on my phone before I went to sleep. Through this project, I've become more self-aware of the things I should/shouldn't continue in order to get good sleep. Additionally, I also put together a code that displayed through different colored circles representing different things. It displayed how tired I felt throughout the day, on days that I worked out vs. didn't work out. </p>

      <div class="box">  <p>This is a photo that captures a moment I'll never forget. This was during the March of the Living Program where my friends and I travelled around Poland alongside the rest of our grade and other students from different schools. In this trip we got the opportunity to look at many Holocaust Camps and grave sights. Although this was a very sad trip, it was a very impactful one that has led me to become closer to my Jewish identity. In this particular photo, my friends and I stood proudly in front of Auschwitz.</p>
